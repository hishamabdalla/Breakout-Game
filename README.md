This project is a classic implementation of the Breakout arcade game using C# and Windows Forms. Breakout is a single-player game where the player controls a paddle to bounce a ball and break bricks arranged at the top of the screen. The objective is to clear all the bricks using the ball without letting it fall off the bottom of the screen.

## Features

- **Player Controls:** Use the left and right arrow keys or mouse to move the paddle horizontally.
- **Dynamic Ball Movement:** The ball moves at varying speeds and angles, bouncing off walls, bricks, and the paddle.
- **Block Breaking:** Break the blocks by bouncing the ball into them. Each block destroyed adds to the player's score.
- **Game Over Conditions:** The game ends if the ball falls off the bottom of the screen or if all the blocks are destroyed.
- **AI Paddle Control:** An AI-controlled paddle moves to intercept the ball, providing an additional challenge.
- **Score Tracking:** The game tracks and displays the player's score, with a win condition achieved by destroying all blocks.

## How to Play

1. Use the left and right arrow keys or mouse to move the paddle.
2. Bounce the ball off the paddle to hit and destroy the bricks.
